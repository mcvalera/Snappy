# Snappy
### Snappy is a web app that allows you to search for photos on Instagram, given a latitude and longitude input.

I built Snappy in one week. It utilizes the Instagram API and features RESTful routing. Technologies used include JavaScript (jQuery and AJAX), Ruby, HTML5, CSS3.

#### What I Learned

This project was amazing in that it was the first web app that I built which used an API. Through this project, I solidified my understanding of RESTful routes and AJAX.

#### What I Would Change

In the future I hope to revise Snappy so that a user can simply input the name of a city or a zipcode in order to view all the photos in that location. I was originally thinking of using the Google Reverse Geocoding API in order to accomplish this, and I would love to integrate that feature when I have time.
